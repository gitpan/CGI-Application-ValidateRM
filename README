NAME
    CGI::Application::ValidateRM - Help validate CGI::Application run modes
    using Data::FormValidator

SYNOPSIS
     use CGI::Application::ValidateRM;

     my ($results,$err_page) = $self->check_rm('form_display','_form_profile');
      return $err_page if $err_page; 

DESCRIPTION
    CGI::Application::ValidateRM helps to validate web forms when using the
    CGI::Application framework and the Data::FormValidator module.

  check_rm
    This CGI::Application method takes two inputs, as follows:

    Return run mode
        This run mode will be used to generate an error page, with the form
        re-filled and error messages in the form. This page will returned as
        a second output parameter.

        The errors will be passed in as a hash reference, which can then be
        handed to a templating system for display.

        The fields should be prepared using Data::FormValidator's built-in
        support for returning error messages as a hash reference. See the
        documentation for "msgs" in the Data::FormValidator::Results
        documentation.

        Returning the errors with a prefix, such as "err_" is recommended.
        Using "any_errors" is also recommended to make it easy to display a
        general "we have some errors" message.

        HTML::Template users may want to pass "die_on_bad_params=>0" to the
        HTML::Template constructor to prevent the presence of the "err_"
        tokens from triggering an error when the errors are *not* being
        displayed.

    Data::FormVaildator profile
        This can either be provided as a hash reference, or as the name of a
        CGI::Application method that will return such a hash reference.

    Additionally, the value of the 'dfv_defaults' param from the calling
    object is optionally used to pass deftauls to the "new()" constructor.

      $self->param('dfv_defaults')

    By setting this to a hash reference of defaults in your "cgiapp_init"
    routine in your own super-class, you could make it easy to share some
    default settings for Data::FormValidator across several forms. Of
    course, you could also set parameter through an instance script.

  validate_rm
    Works like "check_rm" above, but returns the old style $valid hash
    reference instead of the results object.

EXAMPLE
    In a CGI::Application module:

     # This is the run mode that will be validated. Notice that it accepts
     # some errors to be passed in, and on to the template system.
     sub form_display {
            my $self = shift;
            my $errs = shift;
 
            my $t = $self->load_tmpl('page.html');
 
            $t->param($errs) if $errs;
            return $t->output;
     }
 
     sub form_process {
            my $self = shift;
 
            use CGI::Application::ValidateRM;
            my ($results, $err_page) = $self->check_rm('form_display','_form_profile');
            return $err_page if $err_page; 

            #..  do something with DFV $results object now
 
            my $t = $self->load_tmpl('success.html');
            return $t->output;

     }
 
     sub _form_profile {
            return {
                    required => 'email',
                    msgs => {
                            any_errors => 'some_errors', 
                            prefix => 'err_',
                    },
            };
     }

    In page.html:

     <!-- tmpl_if some_errors -->
            <h3>Some fields below are missing or invalid</h3>
     <!-- /tmpl_if -->
     <form>
            <input type="text" name="email"> <!-- tmpl_var err_email -->
     </form>
